# Grover's Algorithm

# Explanation:
# Grover's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database or solving the unstructured search problem.
# It provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms.

# Qiskit Usage:
# Grover's algorithm uses an oracle and a diffusion operator to amplify the probability of the correct solution.

# Import necessary libraries from Qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Function to create an oracle for the search problem
def oracle(qc, n):
    """Apply the oracle to mark the solution state"""
    qc.x(n-1)
    qc.h(n-1)
    qc.mct(list(range(n-1)), n-1)
    qc.h(n-1)
    qc.x(n-1)

# Function to apply the Grover diffusion operator
def diffusion_operator(qc, n):
    """Apply the Grover diffusion operator"""
    qc.h(range(n))
    qc.x(range(n))
    qc.h(n-1)
    qc.mct(list(range(n-1)), n-1)
    qc.h(n-1)
    qc.x(range(n))
    qc.h(range(n))

# Create a quantum circuit with 3 qubits
n = 3
qc = QuantumCircuit(n, n)

# Initialize the qubits in superposition
qc.h(range(n))

# Apply the oracle and diffusion operator
oracle(qc, n)
diffusion_operator(qc, n)

# Measure the qubits
qc.measure(range(n), range(n))

# Use the Aer simulator to execute the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()

# Get the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)
