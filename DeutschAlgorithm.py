# Detailed Explanation of Deutsch's Algorithm

# Introduction:
# Deutsch's Algorithm is one of the earliest examples of a quantum algorithm that demonstrates 
# the power of quantum computing over classical computing. It solves a specific problem faster 
# than any classical algorithm. The problem involves determining whether a given function 
# f: {0,1} -> {0,1} is constant (same output for both inputs) or balanced (different outputs 
# for the two inputs).

# Problem Statement:
# Given a function f that maps {0,1} to {0,1}, determine if f is constant or balanced. 
# Classically, you need to evaluate f(0) and f(1), but Deutsch's algorithm can determine 
# the nature of f with a single evaluation using quantum parallelism.

# Steps of Deutsch's Algorithm:
# 1. Initialization:
#    - Start with two qubits in the state |0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩.
# 2. Apply Hadamard Gates:
#    - Apply a Hadamard gate to each qubit to create a superposition:
#      - The first qubit transforms to (1/sqrt(2))(|0⟩ + |1⟩).
#      - The second qubit transforms to (1/sqrt(2))(|0⟩ - |1⟩).
# 3. Oracle Application:
#    - Apply the oracle Uf which encodes the function f into the quantum state. 
#      The oracle maps |x⟩|y⟩ -> |x⟩|y ⊕ f(x)⟩.
# 4. Apply Hadamard Gate to the First Qubit:
#    - Apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
# 5. Measurement:
#    - Measure the first qubit. The result will determine whether the function f is constant or balanced:
#      - If the result is |0⟩, f is constant.
#      - If the result is |1⟩, f is balanced.

# Quantum Circuit:
# The circuit for Deutsch's algorithm is as follows:
# 1. Initialize qubits: |0⟩ and |1⟩.
# 2. Apply Hadamard gates to both qubits.
# 3. Apply the oracle Uf.
# 4. Apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit.
# 5. Measure the first qubit.

# Simple Example Using Qiskit

# Import necessary libraries from Qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with two qubits and one classical bit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit (qubit 0)
qc.h(0)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the second qubit (qubit 1)
qc.h(1)

# Apply the oracle Uf for f(x) = 0 (constant function)
# The oracle does nothing in this case since f(0) = f(1)
# Example: no gate is needed for a constant zero function

# Apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit (qubit 0)
qc.h(0)

# Measure the first qubit (qubit 0) and store the result in classical bit 0
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Use the Aer simulator to execute the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()

# Get the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)

# More Complex Example Using Qiskit

# In this example, we'll consider an oracle for the balanced function f(x) = x ⊕ 1.

# Import necessary libraries from Qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Create a quantum circuit with two qubits and one classical bit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit (qubit 0)
qc.h(0)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to the second qubit (qubit 1)
qc.h(1)

# Apply the oracle Uf for f(x) = x ⊕ 1 (balanced function)
# This function flips the second qubit when the first qubit is 1
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Apply another Hadamard gate to the first qubit (qubit 0)
qc.h(0)

# Measure the first qubit (qubit 0) and store the result in classical bit 0
qc.measure(0, 0)

# Use the Aer simulator to execute the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()

# Get the measurement results
counts = result.get_counts()

# Plot the results
plot_histogram(counts)

# Conclusion
# Deutsch's Algorithm leverages quantum parallelism to determine if a function is constant or balanced with 
# a single query to the oracle. The simple and complex examples provided demonstrate how to implement this 
# algorithm using Qiskit, with detailed explanations for each step in the code. This understanding lays the 
# foundation for more advanced quantum algorithms.
